# Fruit Image Classification
This project aims to predict a fruit based on an image. The goal is to build a model to identifies which fruit is shown by the image. The model is build using CNN and Transfer Learning method. 
This repository contains the mid semester exam for my 4th semester in Deep Learning Course.

# Files
There are 2 ipynb files. The DL_2_UTS_2602075491_BRANDONRITCHIEYANG_1 (1).ipynb file is using the CNN from scratch method and the transfer_learning_fruit_image_classification_deeplearning.ipynb file is using the transfer learning method
with VGG16 model.

# Dataset
The dataset is provided by the lecturer where each student got 4 different fruit class based on the gender and student ID. The 4 fruit that i got are Cashew, Cempedak, Coconut and Cranberry.
